Welcome to Wenbo YI's Personal Homepage!

I am a Ph.D. student in Cognitive Psychology at [McGill University, Canada](https://www.mcgill.ca/psychology/), where I am advised by [Dr. Caroline Palmer](https://www.mcgill.ca/spl/palmer). Prior to joining McGill, I trained as an audio engineer at the Bachelor's and Master's levels in China. I then obtained my M.Phil. in Music Technology from the [University of Oslo, Norway](https://www.uio.no/english/index.html), where I also worked as a research assistant in the FRONT Neuro Lab at the [RITMO Center of Excellence](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/RITMO) under the guidance of [Dr. Alexander Refsum Jensenius](https://www.uio.no/ritmo/english/people/management/alexanje/index.html) and [Dr. Tor Endestad](https://www.sv.uio.no/psi/english/people/academic/tendesta/)

My research focuses on human behavior related to music perception and production, with an emphasis on using the nonlinear dynamics approach to investigate the mechanisms of rhythmic entrainment. I am especially intrigued by how rhythmic entrainment facilitates human coordination in motor, physiological, and neural oscillations, and how it can be used as an evaluation and therapeutic tool in health-related applications.

Beyond academia, I have a deep passion for classical music. My journey as a concert pianist began at age five, leading to performances in major concert halls and multiple championships at national and provincial levels in China. These experiences have profoundly shaped my interest in music as both an art form and a fundamental perspective on human behavior in science. Now, you can (frequently) find me in Montreal's Place des Arts auditorium:)
